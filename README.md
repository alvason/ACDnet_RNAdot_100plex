# ACDnet_RNAdot_100plex
The quantitative analysis RNA-seq fluorescent gene-expression increasing depends on the accurate segmentation of cells and RNA dot-like expression (RNAdot), a significant challenge for the analysis of high-plex imaging data. We present ACDnet, an efficient and robust deep-learning-based workflow for RNAdot identification and analysis.
